      <p>
        My name is Luke Baal and I am currently in my 4th year of the Software Engineering program at the University of Ontario Institute
        of Technology (UOIT).
        <br>
        <br>In my first four years here at UOIT I have been learning about various programming techniques, such as different
        data structures and languages, such as Java, Python, SQL, PHP, and I can quickly learn new languages. I also have experience in systems programming,
        QA, backend development, and frontend development.
        <br>
        <br>I enrolled in the Software Engineering program because I enjoy and excel in the logical thinking and problem solving
        skills required in software development.
        <br>
        <br>I have a 4.05 average GPA for my first 3.5 years at UOIT and as such I have made the President’s List (Average GPA > 4.0) six times
        and the Dean’s List (Average GPA > 3.7) once.
