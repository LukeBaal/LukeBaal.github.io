      <p>
        My name is Luke Baal and I am currently in my 3rd year of the Software Engineering program at the University of Ontario Institute
        of Technology (UOIT).
        <br>
        <br> In my first three years here at UOIT I have been learning about various programming techniques, such as different
        data structures and languages, such as Java, Python, SQL, PHP, and I can quickly learn new languages.
        <br>
        <br> I enrolled in the Software Engineering program because I enjoy and excel in the logical thinking and problem solving
        skills required in software development.
        <br>
        <br> I have a 4.00 average GPA for my first 2.5 years at UOIT and as such I have made the President’s List three times
        and the Dean’s List once.
